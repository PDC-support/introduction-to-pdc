Compiling and queuing example for PDC
-------------------------------------

This contains a simple example on how to queue and compiler
code for the clusters at PDC.

It contains simple source code for compilation and sbatch scripts.
The source has 3 versions, namely a serial, OpenMP and MPI version
which can be compiled with the same Makefile.

Compilation
-----------

To compile you must see to it that you have the correct
modules loaded into your environment.

Examine the batch files to see what modules need to be loaded
for the cluster that you are currently in.

To compile...

make <cluster name> <source file name without extension>

To compile all source files you can also

make <cluster name> all

Submitting and execute
----------------------

Prior to submit you must change the appriopriate batch
so that <time allocation> variable uses your project.
In case you do not know what project you are part of, run...

projinfo

To submit your program you only need to

sbatch sbatch_<machine name>.sh

Do remember that submission should be made with files situated
in the /cfs/klemming filesystem and not /afs/pdc.kth.se

At the end of the run, you will get a slurm text file with the output
of your run.
