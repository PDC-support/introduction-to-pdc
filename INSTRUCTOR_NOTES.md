# Lessons learned and things to improve

## Lessons learned

- don't assume that the projector in room 304 will work, it was broken on Feb 14 2018
- it's a good idea to bring coffee and paper mugs, and a bottle of water
- double-check and triple-check before course starts that:
  - all participants have PDC accounts 
  - have been added to project allocation (convention: edu18.intropdc)
  - have been added to uname-email
- always bring plenty of extension cords
- be extra clear in the beginning where the current slides can be found (preferably linked from course website)
- include exercises for both Beskow and Tegner (and allow students to choose)
  - highlight differences between the systems
- have a helper at the beginning of the hands-on session! there will always be plenty of kerberos/ssh stuff to figure out

## Fixes:

- use correct allocation name on slide "Launch batch jobs" (with batch job example)

## Ideas:

- use material from HPC-Carpentry: https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/
  - adapt to PDC
  - extend PDC-intro to 1-day workshop
